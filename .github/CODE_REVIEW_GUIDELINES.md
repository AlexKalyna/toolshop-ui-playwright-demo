## üîç Review Process

### 1. Initial Review
- **Timeline**: Within 24 hours of PR creation
- **Focus**: High-level architecture and major issues
- **Action**: Approve, request changes, or add comments

### 2. Detailed Review
- **Timeline**: Within 48 hours of PR creation
- **Focus**: Code quality, security, and edge cases
- **Action**: Thorough line-by-line review

### 3. Final Review
- **Timeline**: Before merging
- **Focus**: Final verification and approval
- **Action**: Approve for merge

## üí¨ Review Comments

### Comment Guidelines
- **Be Specific**: Point to exact lines and explain issues
- **Be Constructive**: Suggest improvements, not just criticism
- **Be Respectful**: Maintain professional tone
- **Be Educational**: Explain why changes are needed

### Comment Types
- **Blocking**: Must be fixed before merge
- **Non-blocking**: Suggestions for improvement
- **Questions**: Clarification requests
- **Praise**: Positive feedback for good work

### Comment Format
```markdown
**Issue**: [Brief description]
**Location**: [File:line]
**Impact**: [Why this matters]
**Suggestion**: [How to fix/improve]
```

## üö´ Common Issues to Watch For

### Code Quality Issues
- **Magic Numbers**: Use constants instead of hardcoded values
- **Long Functions**: Functions should be focused and readable

## üîÑ Review Workflow

### For Reviewers
1. **Read the PR description** and understand the changes
2. **Run tests locally** if needed
3. **Review code systematically** using the checklist
4. **Add comments** for issues and suggestions
5. **Approve or request changes** based on findings

### For Authors
1. **Self-review** your code before submitting
2. **Address all comments** promptly
3. **Update PR** with fixes and explanations
4. **Request re-review** when ready
5. **Thank reviewers** for their time and feedback

## üìä Review Metrics
