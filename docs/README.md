# Project Docs

This folder contains deeper documentation to keep the root README concise for interviewers.

## Quick links

- Patterns: `docs/patterns/factories.md`
- Anti-patterns: `docs/bad-code-examples/`
- Performance tests: `perf/` (see perf/README.md)

## Philosophy

- Keep the main surface area minimal and prod-like.
- Extra demos and educational content live here to avoid noise in daily workflows.
